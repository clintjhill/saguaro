Saguaro Stoneworks Project


INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Saguaro Stoneworks Project! This is a Java Swing application
that allows Saguaro Stoneworks to prepare brick mosaic jobs. They wanted to
be able to "draw" out the project and be given printable inventory reports.

REQUIREMENTS
To run this project you will need Java SE 5 SDK. As well there are jar files 
included in this project for GUI Look and Feel as well as reporting. Here are
the URL's for all of these requirements.

	Java SDK:
	No J2EE classes were used in the building of this project so only the desktop
	or Standard SDK is needed.

MORE INFORMATION
This project was developed using the Eclipse IDE version 3.2. 
This project was developed initially on a IBM Thinkpad T42p Windows XP machine 
using Java 1.4.2 but is now developed on a MacBook Pro machine using Java 1.5.0. 
Great care was taken to insure the portability of this project, and as such no
bin files are provided (no build files are in SVN). All of the other jar files 
are in the /lib folder and added to the .classpath file for the Eclipse project.

INSTALLATION NOTES
Checkout the SVN /trunk using Eclipse with the Subclipse plugin. From there you
should have the jar files necessary to run this application.
